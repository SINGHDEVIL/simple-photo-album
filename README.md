# Simple Photo Album

This is a basic photo album web application created using HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. The application displays images in a layout of three images per page, featuring one main image and two smaller images. It includes basic pagination to navigate through multiple pages of images.

## Project Structure


- `index.php`: The main file that contains the HTML structure and integrates the PHP to load images.
- `style.css`: The stylesheet that provides styling to the photo album layout.
- `script.js`: A JavaScript file for any future interactivity (currently empty).
- `images/`: Directory for storing the sample images used in the photo album.

## Requirements

- A web server with PHP support (e.g., Apache, Nginx).
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

## Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   - If using Git, run the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone <repository-url>
     ```
   - Alternatively, download the ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Setup the Web Server:**
   - Place the project folder in the web server's root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP or `www` for WAMP).
   - Ensure the web server is running.

3. **Add Sample Images:**
   - Place your sample images in the `images/` directory. You can add any image files (e.g., .jpg, .png) that you want to display.

4. **Access the Application:**

     ```
     http://localhost/Simple-Photo-Album/index.php
     ```
